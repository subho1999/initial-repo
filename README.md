# initial-repo

Hi, Homo-sapiens-sapiens,
It's Subho here.
This will be my first repo on GitHub with my very initial codes. :D
Had to make a Github account coz I hear that's the thing that's gonna be the primary part of my digital footprint.

Let's see where it goes. I just started learning coding in my college (1st year). Hope this repo is filled with actual useful contributions after 4 years.

Have a great day!1
